###Greed Kata  
This is the sample code from one of our groups doing the Greed kata at the Paired Programming meet up. I finished refactoring out the scoring into its own class so that the Greed object didn't have to know how the score was computed, just that it could get a score. Doing so, I added a protocol called ScoreKeeperType to which the ScoreKeeper conformed, allowing us to mock this out while testing and inject a set of test rolls with known input to calculate various scores to ensure our score keeper's accuracy. Now that we have a test suite backing the functionality of the Greed object and score, the ScoreKeeper's implementation could be refactored safely with the knowledge that our tests will tell us if the refactor worked or not for all cases.
